# rock-paper-scissors
Author: Nathan Jack Luna

IDE Used: Visual Studio Code

This is an Odin Project assignment, where I will create a simple rock-paper-scissors game
all inside of the console log of a HTML webpage. This project made me think about creating 
functions and creating certain variables within a function, as well as creating global functions. 
For my very first javascript project, I am very surprised at how quickly I was able to pickup 
some of the syntax for the language, as it is fairly similar to C++, my primary programming 
language of choice.
