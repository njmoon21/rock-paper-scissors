# rock-paper-scissors
Author: Nathan Jack Luna

IDE Used: Visual Studio Code

Ver. 1:

This is an Odin Project assignment, where I will create a simple rock-paper-scissors game
all inside of the console log of a HTML webpage. This project made me think about creating 
functions and creating certain variables within a function, as well as creating global functions. 
For my very first javascript project, I am very surprised at how quickly I was able to pickup 
some of the syntax for the language, as it is fairly similar to C++, my primary programming 
language of choice.

Ver. 2:

I implemented all my basic JavaScript file for practicing DOM manipulation. I also added a CSS file in 
order to make the webpage more appealing. You can now fully play the project by interacting with the user
interface that was created!
